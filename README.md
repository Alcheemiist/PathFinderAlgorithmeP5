# Path Finding Visualizer using A* algorithm
Path Finding Visualizer is a web-based application that uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest path with least turns between two points on a grid. The app visualizes the process by animating the algorithm as it searches for the optimal path, allowing users to understand how the A* algorithm works. Users can also interact with the app by adjusting the grid size, placing obstacles on the grid and adjusting the heuristic value to see the impact on the algorithm's performance.
